# CopyChat for Forge 1.8.9
intended to copy chat messages in Minecraft

### **Currently WIP**
the copying works but now the issue is it doesn't copy the entire chat message \
this may be due to how minecraft's IChatComponent stores the messages in 'chunks', \
and i still havent figured out a way to combine all 'chunks' into one message, let alone be \
able to find those 'chunks'
